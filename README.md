# Security Configurations README

This README file outlines specific security configurations for users or repositories along with their compliance categories according to NIST standards.


## Configuration 1: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Description:** Enable Multi-Factor Authentication for all user accounts.

**NIST Compliance Category:** Access Control

**Automation:** Use a script or third-party tool to regularly check and enforce MFA status for all user accounts.

### Non-Technical Explanation:

**Best Practice:**
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user accounts to add an extra layer of security. MFA requires users to provide multiple forms of identification, enhancing protection against unauthorized access.

**Configuration Meaning:**
MFA mandates users to provide two or more verification factors, typically a password and a second form of identification (e.g., a mobile app code). This ensures a more secure authentication process.

**Risks of Non-Compliance:**
Without MFA, user accounts are more vulnerable to unauthorized access. If a password is compromised, an attacker could gain control, leading to potential data breaches or malicious activities.

**Steps to Fix Manually:**
1. Access your GitHub account settings.
2. Navigate to the Multi-Factor Authentication section.
3. Enable MFA and follow the provided instructions.

**Impact on GitHub Usage:**
Enabling MFA adds an extra step during login, requiring a second verification after entering the password. This may slightly increase login time but significantly enhances account security.

**MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:**
- **T1110 - Brute Force:** MFA protects against brute force attacks by requiring an additional verification factor, even if the password is compromised.

**Mitigation:**
Regularly monitor account activity, educate users about MFA benefits, and implement account lockout policies to prevent unauthorized access.


## Configuration 2: Repository Branch Protection

**Description:** Implement branch protection rules to prevent force pushes and ensure a code review before merging changes into the main branch.

**NIST Compliance Category:** System and Communications Protection

**Automation:** Leverage Git hooks or CI/CD pipelines to enforce branch protection rules automatically.


## Configuration 3: Regular Password Rotation

**Description:** Enforce regular password rotation for user accounts.

**NIST Compliance Category:** Access Control

**Automation:** Implement a password policy and utilize automated tools to prompt users for password changes at regular intervals.


## Configuration 4: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Description:** Implement Role-Based Access Control to assign permissions based on user roles, ensuring least privilege access.

**Compliance Category:** Access Control

**Automation:** Use identity management tools (such Auth0) or custom scripts to automatically assign and revoke roles based on predefined access policies. Regularly audit and adjust roles as needed.


## Configuration 5: Access Control for Sensitive Resources

**Description:** Implement strict access controls for sensitive repositories or resources, ensuring that only authorized users have access.

**NIST Compliance Category:** Access Control

**Automation:** Use identity and access management (IAM) tools to automatically review and adjust access permissions based on predefined policies.
